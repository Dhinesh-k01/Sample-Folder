created a file inside a sub branch 

i) don't forget that whenever we are creating a new branch we have to use "git pull" command to see changes in locally 
ii) again follow the 3 steps to save these changes in github
      1) git add . / filename
      2) git commit -m "some message" 
      3) git push origin main/master which branch you're in!
